Happy Birthday Pascal!
Sorry it's a little bit late... 
First of all, I wanted to say thank you for your support with me and Gabriela, I really love your daughter and she
brought me so much joy into my life! I feel very welcomed when I come to your house and I love spending time with your family.
I Hope God blesses you this year with your heart wishes and
